/**
 * SPIKE — Milestone 1 of the in-app Steam downloader (memory in_app_game_downloader.md).
 *
 * Proves JavaSteam's high-level {@link DepotDownloader} can fetch the RimWorld (Linux) depot
 * ON THE DEVICE: log in (credentials → Steam-Mobile approval push, same as Milestone 0), receive
 * the account's licenses, then run DepotDownloader for the RimWorld Linux depot. The downloader
 * fetches the manifest, the (ownership-gated) depot key, downloads + decompresses the CDN chunks
 * (VZip via xz / VZstd via zstd-jni) and lays them out under an absolute install dir.
 *
 * NO token storage: the refresh token is kept ONLY in memory (a field) for this run, never written
 * to disk — exactly per the project constraint. The in-memory copy lets us re-logon transparently
 * after a transient CM disconnect WITHOUT another Steam Mobile approval.
 *
 * Resilience: the first on-device test failed because the CM websocket dropped (the app was briefly
 * backgrounded for the Steam Mobile approval) and we gave up on the first disconnect. Now we
 * reconnect + retry the download up to {@link #MAX_DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPTS} times. The download params
 * mirror the user's known-good DepotDownloader command exactly (explicit depot + manifest) to
 * remove the DLC-depot iteration and the manifest-version-resolution round trip.
 *
 * Run on a BACKGROUND thread (blocks in a callback loop + awaitCompletion). Pure network client.
